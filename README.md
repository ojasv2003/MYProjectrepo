This is a data science project focused on predicting the likelihood of heart attacks using machine learning.
Key Features:
Dataset Analysis: Processes a heart disease dataset containing 303 entries with 14 clinical features, including age, sex, chest pain type (cp), cholesterol levels (chol), and maximum heart rate achieved (thalach).
Data Exploration: Includes comprehensive data summaries and statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, and range) for all health indicators.
Predictive Modeling: Implements a Logistic Regression model to classify heart attack risk.
Performance Visualization:
Generates a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve to evaluate model accuracy (achieving an AUC of 0.90).
Features a Feature Importance bar plot to identify which clinical factors most significantly contribute to heart attack possibility.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical processing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For generating diagnostic and performance visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For building the Logistic Regression model and calculating evaluation metrics.
